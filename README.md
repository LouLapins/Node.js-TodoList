# Node.js-TodoList

School project in Node.js with Express and EJS. My teacher chose EJS because we haven't started learning React or Angular yet.
The purpose of the project is to learn CRUD - creating, reading, updating and deleting data from a database.


## Installation

- Clone the repository: ```https://github.com/LouLapins/Node.js-TodoList.git```

- To install all dependencies run command
```npm i``` in terminal

- To run application run command 
```npm start``` in terminal

Note that the URI to my database is stored in a hidden .env file that is not included in this repository, 
so you will need to register your own account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) in order to use this app.
